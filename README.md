# slackbot templates

## Scope
This is a basic template for building out slack bots. I took this code from Tech with Tim [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ5bFv-IRFM&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kqyzTzJWCV6lyK-ZMYECDc).

## Usage

Create a `.env` file with at least:
```
SLACK_TOKEN=""
SIGNING_SECRET=""
```

The [app_manifest.yaml](./app_manifest.yaml) has the settings needed for the full bot on Slack.
